# neoPixelBT
Mobile app created in cordova to control NeoPixel leds through Bluetooth

just notes for me

Start blog item with
"I started this project to fulfill a life long dream...
Creating light for those in the dark"

few intresting facts (Things I learned)
* for 1 I created a dynamic menu.... or I have done it half way in the menu.js
* I discovered I can use Bootstrap inside cordova framework, It helps with screen designs

TO-DO
* on loading do the load spinner in a modal kindof way
* start scanning for BT devices when app opens, and add refresh button on Connect to BT
* Add color modes, like Flashing, Glow, strobe and Rainbow
